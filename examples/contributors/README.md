# Contributor Brag Documents

This directory contains automatically generated brag documents for contributors to the brag-ai project.

## What is a Brag Document?

A brag document is a personal record of your professional accomplishments, contributions, and impact. It helps you track your progress, showcase your work during performance reviews, and build confidence in your professional growth.

## How These Documents are Generated

These brag documents are automatically generated and maintained by a [GitHub workflow](../../.github/workflows/contributor-brags.yaml) that runs whenever changes are merged to the `main` branch.

The workflow uses the `brag-ai` tool itself to generate these documents - a great example of "eating our own dog food" or "dogfooding".

## Privacy Consideration

These documents are publicly accessible as part of the repository and generated from publicly available GitHub data.
If you're a contributor and would prefer not to have your brag document included, please open an issue.
