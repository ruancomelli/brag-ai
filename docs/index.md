## Overview

Ever had that moment when your manager asks "So, what have you been up to?" and your mind goes blank?

Brag AI is your personal achievement historian! It helps you create and maintain a "brag document" - a fancy record of all the cool stuff you've done. It dives into your GitHub activity and transforms those cryptic commit messages into beautiful, human-readable achievements that will make your portfolio shine! ✨

Perfect for:

- 📊 Performance reviews (without the last-minute panic)
- 💼 Job applications (show off with style)
- 📈 Personal development tracking (watch yourself grow!)
- 🎉 Impressing your friends (and maybe your pet - results may vary)

- 🏠 **Local Repository Support**: Generate brag documents from local Git repositories
- 🤖 **AI-Powered**: Turns "fix: bug in login" into "Enhanced system reliability by resolving critical authentication issues"

## Why Brag AI?

Maintaining a brag document is crucial for career development, but it's often overlooked or forgotten until it's time for a performance review.
Brag AI automates this process, helping you capture your achievements while they're fresh or after a long time.
